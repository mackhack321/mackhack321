## **Hello there**

### My name is Mack, and I really like to code.

#### I am pretty good at:
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Python
  - C++
  - C
  - Linux
  - Networking (i.e. restarting the router when the WiFi goes out)
  - Documentation
  - Googling things
  - Working in and leading a team
  - Getting things done on time

I am always very eager to learn new things, especially when it comes to technology and software development.

Thank you for stopping by.  If you are an employer, [please hire me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mack-stanley-674919190/).
