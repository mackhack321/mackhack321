## **Hello there :)**

### My name is Mack, and I really, *really*, ***really*** like to code.

I am pretty good at:
  - Python
  - Java
  - C++
  - C#
  - Linux
  - Robot Operating System (ROS)
  - Networking (i.e. restarting the router when the WiFi goes out)
  - Documentation
  - Googling things
  - Working in and leading a team
  - Getting things done on time

I have also played with:
  - MySQL
  - Swift
  - HTML
  - Javascript
  - Electron
  - Xamarin

I am always very eager to learn new things, especially when it comes to technology and software development.

My GitHub page is more just me playing around and teaching myself new skills than a collection of huge and impressive projects.
However, there is still some cool stuff to look at here.

I am proud of my KroCal project that I made during my employment at my local Kroger grocery store.  KroCal is a simple Python scripting project that used webscraping and
the Google Calendar API to yank my work schedule off of Kroger's employee schedule page and insert it into my Google Calendar which was a lot more quick and painless to check.
I stuck it on one of my Linux machines and had it run every Friday with a cron job, so every Friday when my new schedule got posted, I could just peek at my Google Calendar and
there it all was.  
You can look at it [here](https://github.com/mackhack321/KroCal).

Another cool thing I made came out of me teaching myself Javascript and NodeJS.  I made a simple volunteer hour tracker using Electron to both present a frontend and talk
to a MySQL database.  I needed volnteer hours for school and figured I could turn it into a fun project, and I think it turned out pretty well.  
You can look at that [here](https://github.com/mackhack321/nhshours).

Thank you for stopping by.  If you are an employer, [please hire me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mack-stanley-674919190/).
